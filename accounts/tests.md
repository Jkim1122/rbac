Introduction
This document describes the purpose and expected behavior of the test cases defined in the tests.py file. These tests ensure that the user management functionalities, such as signup, login, and profile access, work as intended. Additionally, they verify that content is conditionally displayed based on user roles (Admin and User).
Setup Method
The setUp method is a special method in Django's TestCase class that runs before each test case. It is used to create initial data that will be used in multiple tests.
Purpose:
•	Create Groups: The Admin and User groups are created or retrieved.
•	Create Users: Two users are created:
o	admin_user: A user assigned to the Admin group.
o	regular_user: A user assigned to the User group.
Code Example:
def setUp(self):
    # Create the roles/groups
    admin_group, _ = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='Admin')
    user_group, _ = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='User')

    # Create an Admin user
    self.admin_user = User.objects.create_user(
        username='admin_user',
        password='AdminPassword123!'
    )
    self.admin_user.groups.add(admin_group)

    # Create a regular User
    self.regular_user = User.objects.create_user(
        username='regular_user',
        password='UserPassword123!'
    )
    self.regular_user.groups.add(user_group)
Test Cases
Signup View Tests
These tests verify the functionality of the signup page, ensuring that users can create accounts and are appropriately redirected based on the success or failure of their signup attempt.
test_signup_view_get
•	Purpose: Ensure the signup page is accessible via a GET request.
•	Expected Behavior: The signup page should load successfully, returning a 200 status code and using the correct template.
test_signup_view_post_valid
•	Purpose: Test the signup process with valid data.
•	Expected Behavior: A new user should be created, and the user should be redirected to the signup success page.
test_signup_view_post_invalid
•	Purpose: Test the signup process with invalid data (e.g., a password that doesn’t meet the validation criteria).
•	Expected Behavior: The user should be redirected to the signup failure page, and no user should be created.
Login View Tests
These tests verify that the login page functions correctly, allowing users to log in with valid credentials and preventing login with invalid credentials.
test_login_view_get
•	Purpose: Ensure the login page is accessible via a GET request.
•	Expected Behavior: The login page should load successfully, returning a 200 status code and using the correct template.
test_login_view_post_valid
•	Purpose: Test the login process with valid credentials.
•	Expected Behavior: The user should be logged in and redirected to their profile page.
test_login_view_post_invalid
•	Purpose: Test the login process with invalid credentials.
•	Expected Behavior: The user should not be logged in, and an error message should be displayed.
Profile View Tests
These tests ensure that the profile page displays the correct content based on the user's role.
test_profile_view_for_admin
•	Purpose: Test the profile view when accessed by an Admin user.
•	Expected Behavior: The profile page should display admin-specific content (e.g., "Admin Panel").
test_profile_view_for_user
•	Purpose: Test the profile view when accessed by a regular User.
•	Expected Behavior: The profile page should display user-specific content (e.g., "User Dashboard").
Logout View Test
This test verifies that the logout functionality works correctly, logging the user out and redirecting them to the logout success page.
test_logout_view
•	Purpose: Test the logout process.
•	Expected Behavior: The user should be logged out and redirected to the logout success page.
Running the Tests
To run the test cases, use the following command:
bash
Copy code
python manage.py test
This command will execute all the test cases in the tests.py file and report the results.
